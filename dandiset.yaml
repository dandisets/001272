description: Experiments were conducted using the potentiometric dye Di8-ANEPPS, which
  detects voltage through an electrochromic mechanism, differing from the photo-induced
  electron transfer mechanism. The goal was to ensure that action potentials recorded
  with FluoVolt (published in other DANDIsets) were not influenced by the dye when
  applying intense sinewaves. Control experiments were performed using Di8-ANEPPS,
  chosen for its distinct molecular structure and voltage detection method. This study
  was partially supported by the NIH Brain Initiative (NEI R21EY034803).
