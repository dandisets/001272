description: "Experiments were conducted using a potentiometric dye, Di8-ANEPPS, which
  has a distinct molecular structure and detects voltage via an electrochromic mechanism,
  unlike the photo-induced electron transfer mechanism in FluoVolt. The aim of these
  experiments was to rule out the possibility that action potentials that were recorded
  using FluoVolt dye (published in other DANDIsets) were not influenced by dye itself
  when applying intense sinewaves. To address this, control experiments were conducted
  with an alternative potentiometric dye, Di8-ANEPPS, which differs in molecular structure
  and operates through an electrochromic mechanism of voltage detection, unlike the
  photo-induced electron transfer mechanism utilized by FluoVolt. Experiments were
  conducted on eight neurons, with electric field strengths applied in a randomized
  order. \nThese experiments were carried out in eight neurons, with varying electric
  field strengths applied in a randomized sequence. \n08 06 24"
